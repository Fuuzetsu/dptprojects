This is a relatively small list of projects designed to answer the
common question of ‘what project could I work on’ asked by many
programmers, usually beginners or people that haven't been involved
with much FOSS work before.

While it was designed to suit the needs of Daily Programming Threads,
anyone is welcome to use it and make changes to it.
